Model Observation Script
Author: Greg Blumberg OU/CIMMS

Recent changes to AERIoe by Dave Turner have included the option to have a thermodynamic profile be a "Y-vector" observation in the retrieval.  This facilitates the addition of radiosonde/Raman Lidar/DIAL data as inputs into the AERIoe retrieval.  As a consequence, we have decided to remove the AERI model prior concept from our processing and instead use a model thermodynamic profile as another "observation" into the AERIoe retrieval.  This enables a better retrieval in the mid-to-upper atmosphere.  This script will perform the conversions from the model grids into the model-profile netCDF files that AERIoe can now accept as inputs. 

This script takes in a set of either real-time or archived model data (e.g. ARM-RUC grids or realtime RAP/HRRR data or NCDC archived RUC data or realtime GFS) and a lat/lon point.  It then pulls the temperature and water vapor mixing ratio profile for each time at that point to develop a netCDF file.  The output file contains the time/height data for temperature and water vapor mixing ratio, pressure, height, temp_std, and wvmr_std. It also contains metadata about how the file was made.

   This code currently supports making these files from:
   - realtime RAP profiles
   - ARM-formatted RUC/RAP files

   Arguments:
       [1] YYYYMMDD - date of AERI file to run (ex: 20130531)
       [2] VIP file - path to config file (ex: nwc_vip.txt)
       [3] BHOUR - beginning hour of profiles (ex: 5)
       [4] EHOUR - ending hour of profiles (ex: 5)
