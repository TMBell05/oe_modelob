Model Observation Script
Author: Greg Blumberg OU/CIMMS

Recent changes to AERIoe by Dave Turner have included the option to have a thermodynamic profile be a "Y-vector" observation in the retrieval.  This facilitates the addition of radiosonde/Raman Lidar/DIAL data as inputs into the AERIoe retrieval.  As a consequence, we have decided to remove the AERI model prior concept from our processing and instead use a model thermodynamic profile as another "observation" into the AERIoe retrieval.  This enables a better retrieval in the mid-to-upper atmosphere.  This script will perform the conversions from the model grids into the model-profile netCDF files that AERIoe can now accept as inputs. 

This script takes in a set of either real-time or archived model data (e.g. ARM-RUC grids or realtime RAP/HRRR data or NCDC archived RUC data or realtime GFS) and a lat/lon point.  It then pulls the temperature and water vapor mixing ratio profile for each time at that point to develop a netCDF file.  The output file contains the time/height data for temperature and water vapor mixing ratio, pressure, height, temp_std, and wvmr_std. It also contains metadata about how the file was made.

   This code currently supports making these files from:
   - realtime RAP profiles
   - ARM-formatted RUC/RAP files

   Arguments:
       [1] YYYYMMDD - date of AERI file to run (ex: 20130531)
       [2] VIP file - path to config file (ex: nwc_vip.txt)
       [3] BHOUR - beginning hour of profiles (ex: 5)
       [4] EHOUR - ending hour of profiles (ex: 5)

    Output:
        Files of the name format of: RRmodelsoundings.YYYYMMDD.HH.LAT.LON.cdf

ABOUT THE VIP FILE:

The VIP file is similar to the AERIoe format in order to reduce the number of files needed to run AERIoe.
Here are the variables included in the VIP file, along with a description of them:

Variable: data_source
Required?: YES
Options: 1 - NOAA NOMADS RAP/RUC analysis archive
         2 - ARM-formatted RAP/RUC hourly analysis files
         3 - 13 km RAP Motherlode UCAR data server (forecast and analysis data)
Description:
These three options can be used to generate files for different AERI data.
    1 - contains analysis data for the CONUS back to 2010, however data outages are sporatic.
        More recent data may be less sporadic.  This data source is recommended when you need
        model observations outside of the SGP, however it may work for the 2011-2013 NWC AERI deployment.

    2 - Contains analysis data for the SGP back to the 90s.  You'll have to download this data from the ARM archive
        however data for this does exist on the ARM cluster and the RAID.  The data files need to be hourly and of the format:

            sgpallruc60X1.c0        05/08/1996  to  04/23/1998  (not tested)
            sgpallruc40isobX1.c1    04/20/1998  to  04/16/2002  (tested)
            sgpsynruc20isobX1.c1    04/18/2002  to  05/01/2012  (tested)
            sgpsynrap20plevX1.c1    05/01/2012  to  current     (tested)

        The ARM archive also supports data on the native grid (hybrid levels).  Support for this data type has not been implemented
        in this program, however it may happen in the future since the hybrid levels provide a higher resolution data grid than
        these isobaric files.

        Selection of this data source option requires implementing the "arm_model_dir" VIP variable.

    3 - Uses analysis and forecast data from the 13 km RAP data located on the UCAR Motherlode server.
        This data source semi-realtime data from the last 2 weeks and is updated regularly.  When using this data source,
        the program will use forecast data if analysis data does not exist for the time frame specified.  It is recommended that
        this data source is used for real-time generation of RAP Model Observation files.
